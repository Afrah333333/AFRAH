<hr/>
<p>Web design class has been pretty interesting ever since i joined with the students making it extremely fun and the teacher ensuring everyone has grasped all the concepts entirely.</p>

<h1><b><i><u> WHAT MAKES IT THE BEST CLASS </b></i></u> </h1>
<p>I was able to learn alot and what makes it most interesting is the new concepts we are learning and the fact that we are able to build our own websites.</p>
